						duration * 7
					} exchanges, aiming for a concise transcript that would last between ${duration} minutes. The person attribute should either be ${agentA} or ${agentB}. The line attribute should be that character's line of dialogue. It should delve into thought-provoking concepts while maintaining a dynamic and conversational tone, balancing intrigue with scientific rigor. I also need an asset description under the asset attribute which would be a relevant search query to find an image that aligns with the scientific nature of the conversation. The asset descriptions shouldn't be vague but should describe specific, scientifically relevant imagery that supports the dialogue's theme. Avoid direct mention of politicians; instead, use general descriptors or features to convey similar ideas in a neutral way. The JSON format WHICH MUST BE ADHERED TO ALWAYS is as follows: { transcript: { [ {'person': 'the exact value of ${agentA} or ${agentB} depending on who is talking', 'line': 'their line of conversation in the dialog', asset: 'relevant search query based on the current line'} ] } }`,

					)} presenting deeper theoretical insights. Push their characteristics to the extreme to make the conversation captivating while ensuring the content remains scientifically accurate and thought-provoking.`,
